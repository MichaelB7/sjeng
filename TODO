TODO

3. Root move ordering based on node counts
5. Do king-safety at root and maybe tell partner whether trades are good
6b. Reimplement hashtables (save move to avoid movegen ?)
7. Check Internal iterative deepening (prolly not working)
12a. BPGN support
13. Prevent blocking of rooks at a8 in standard mode (cfr. crafty)
15. Just keep researching if dead
16. Remove has_castled dependencies
17. If partner tells +++ override alpha-beta with a special check
20. Split up movegen to do captures and normal moves seperately
23. Add endgame database support
24. Experiment with TD learning

MAYBE

8. Threat heuristics
11. Add a feature to anticipate trades
12. Force moving into mate

DIDN'T WORK

18. No legal move check if move is from hashtable
